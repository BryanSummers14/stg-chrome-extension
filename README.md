# stg-chrome-extension

A fix for the tiny section for notes in the stg salesforce reporting app.

## install steps
1. Click on the github link
2. Click 'clone or download', and select 'download zip'
3. extract the zip file
4. go to your chrome settings and click 'extensions' on the top left
5. click 'load unpacked extension' and then select the folder you extracted
It will work automatically any time it detects the 'stgconsulting.force' url
You will see a message saying to disable extensions in developer mode whenever you start chrome and you can click cancel to ignore it. This is because I didn't go through the chrome store.
