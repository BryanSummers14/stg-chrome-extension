# stg-chrome-extension

Various enchancements for the timesheet page for STG consultants.
*Prevents user from being auto-logged out after timeout
*Properly aligns columns for billable hours and PTO hours
*Makes notes section bigger


## install steps
1. Click on the github link
2. Click 'clone or download', and select 'download zip'
3. extract the zip file
4. go to your chrome settings and click 'extensions' on the top left
5. click 'load unpacked extension' and then select the folder you extracted

It will work automatically any time it detects the 'stgconsulting.force' url.
Because I didn't go through the Chrome store you will see a message saying to disable extensions in developer mode whenever you start chrome. Click cancel to ignore it or the extension won't run.
